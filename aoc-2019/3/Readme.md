This was one of the most in-efficient codes I compiled.

I want an efficient way to complete the tasks.

Also, I used char instead of using the automatic input detection for int input between the commas that added roughly 4 operations per 1 iteration of the input loop.

Also, I wonder if taxicab geometry will help me synthesize a better algorithm to solve this.

Anyways, coming back to this later after more research.
