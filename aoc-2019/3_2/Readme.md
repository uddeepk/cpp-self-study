Also, read the notes in ../3. 

This is the part two to AOC-2019 day 3. I am keeping this code too though it is almost identical to the last one. The only changes was how I put the number of steps instead of co-ordinates in the minimum. The output turns out correct. 

As with part 1, I want a more efficient way to perform these two computations. With my computer, it took ~9 minutes for my computer to finish running the code...
