Checker using c++

This is a jumblefuck of code. It works though.

The main issues were not knowing the rules of the game, thus my algorithm was messed up.

If efficacy is the focus, then I have made something functional.

Though it can be made more efficient.

I have left this crude coding up on github to look at later.

Possible ideas are to use more vectors, and store valid moveset instead of referring to the move set again and again.

Beautify the code by
branching that is visibly apparent.
less usage of continue statements...
